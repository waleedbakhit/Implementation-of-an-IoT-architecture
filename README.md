# Implementation-of-an-IoT-architecture
The building facilities are permanent assets, and they need to be constantly maintained over time. Therefore, methods must be available to follow up on the facilities to provide preventive maintenance to maintain the facility in a proper condition. Over the last 20 years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology has greatly improved, and it has proven to be very useful for the management of buildings. BIM exploits 3D models, data, and documents regarding a building, in order to manage and coordinate the different phases of its lifecycle (plan, design, build, operation and maintenance). The main problem facing most of today's facilities is the lack of necessary information and data about their status and condition.  The aim of this thesis is to apply the Internet of Things (IoT) approach to develop an open-source architecture by connecting sensors and microcontrollers inside the facilities to constantly monitor their status. Data are then transmitted through an Internet network to a database for a following analysis for preventive maintenance. the collected data are also integrated in the BIM model of the facilities to have constantly updated information about their status. Since the developed architecture is completely open source, it can be easily expanded in the future to include more types of elements and devices.
